Consider it done
\subsection{}
To compute the pair-wise correlation coefficients we used the following command:
\begin{lstlisting}[title= Input]
load('lab1_1.mat')
corrcoef(lab1_1)
\end{lstlisting}
This yields us the following table of correlation coefficients:
%\begin{lstlisting}[title= Output]
%   1.0000   -0.0615    0.7156
%  -0.0615    1.0000    0.5142
%   0.7156    0.5142    1.0000
%\end{lstlisting}
\begin{table}[H]
	\caption{\textit{Pair-wise correlation coefficients}}
	\vspace{0.1cm}
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		& Length & Age & Weight \\
		\hline
		Length & 1 & -0.0615 & 0.7156 \\
		\hline
		Age & -0.615 & 1 & 0.5142 \\
		\hline
		Weight & 0.7156 & 0.5142 & 1 \\ 
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\label{tab1.2}
\end{table}

		The two features for which the correlation is the largest are the first and third column, respectively the height and the weight.

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{}
\end{figure}
From a scatterplot alone it is hard to draw conclusions about any possible relationships between the different features. 
We do get indications though; figure \ref{fig1.3a} shows that there is likely to be a correlation between the weight and the height.
An increase in weight seems to correspond to a (somewhat linear) increase in height. 
A similar kind of relationship can be seen in figure \ref{fig1.3b}, between the factors weight and age.

\section{Assignment 2}
\setcounter{subsection}{2}
\subsection{Sets S and D}
The following subsections show the code we used to acquire the 1000 Hamming distances for set S and D.
\subsubsection{}
\begin{lstlisting}[title = Code for set S]
hd_s = zeros(1,1000);
for i = 1:1000
person = randi([1,20]);
row1 = randi([1,20]);
row2 = row1;
while(row1 == row2)
row2 = randi([1,20]);
end
load(sprintf('person%02d.mat',person));

hd_s(i) = sum(abs(iriscode(row1,:)-iriscode(row2,:)));
end
hd_s = hd_s/30;
\end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection{}
\begin{lstlisting}[title = Code for set D]
hd_d = zeros(1,1000);
for i = 1:1000
person1 = randi([1,20]);
row1 = randi([1,20]);
row2 = randi([1,20]);
person2 = person1;
while(person1 == person2)
person2 = randi([1,20]);
end
load(sprintf('person%02d.mat',person1));
x = iriscode(row1,:);
load(sprintf('person%02d.mat',person2));
y = iriscode(row2,:);
hd_d(i) = sum(abs(x-y));
end
hd_d = hd_d/30;
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Histogram}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{plot2_4.png}
	\caption{Dus..}
	\label{fig2.4}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig2.4} shows the histogram of sets S and D. The figure shows that the two distributions overlap very little, most of it around $hd = 5,6$.

\subsection{}
The means and variances of both of the sets are the following:
\begin{table}[H]
 \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
  \hline
  Set & Mean & Variance & Standard deviation \\
  \hline
  S & 0.0825 & 0.0016 & 0.0398 \\
  \hline
  D & 0.4946 & 0.0079 & 0.0886 \\
  \hline
 \end{tabular}
 \caption{Means and variances of both of the sets}
 \label{tab2.5}
\end{table}
The prior probability of two bits being the same between persons the following is: $1-0.4946=0.5054$.
Using the formula $n=p(1-p)/\sigma^2$ we get $n=(0.4946*(1-0.4946))/(0.0886^2)\approx 31.84$ statistically independent bits that are needed to encode an iris pattern. This means that the current number of bits in the iris vectors is insufficient.

\section{Assignment 3}
\subsection{Background}
The topic of biometric identification has been receiving a lot of attention lately.
The use of fingerprints, facial features, and iris recognition are considered appropriate for identification.
Of these three, fingerprints and iris recognition are considered to be more accurate than facial features,
while facial featuresare more flexible, e.g.\ for the use in surveillance scenarios.
A possible improvement for the performance of facial feature identification is the combination of information from multiple sources,
for instance the ear.
Ear images can be obtained in a similar maner to face images, 
and a recent study suggests that they are comparable in recognition power\cite{chang2003comparison},
and a combination of the sources gives a significant improvement over their individual performance.
